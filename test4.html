Display five small images in a row along the bottom of a web page. The images can be any graphics files you wish.
Each small image shall be a link to some valid website of your choice.
There shall be a large image element in the upper part of the page which
initially is the same image as the leftmost small image, but its width and
height shall be twice that of the small one. It shall be a link to the same website as the small image.

When you mouse over any small image, the following two things shall occur:
1.  The large image shall change to that of the small image, but its width and height shall be twice that of the small one.
2.  The large image shall become a link to the same website as the small image.
Hint: The page can be implemented in 31 lines of code including all the HTML and
JavaScript and works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and IE. Here's a screenshot of it running:
